# Tech Blog MVC - Module Challenge 14
## Challenge Details
We were asked to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This application follows MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

This application was built from scratch using Express Handlebars, MySQL, Sequelize, dotenv, and bcrypt. The CSS Framework used was Bulma.

## Usage
The following application can be found here: https://desolate-reaches-61347.herokuapp.com/

To run locally, after cloning repo and navigating to the root folder:

```mysql -u root -p```

```source db/schema.sql```

```quit```

```npm run seeds```

```npm start```
